# Algorithm of Choice: Binary Search Algorithm
---
### I was unsure what exactly *"the algorithm"* was referring to, so I decided to choose to analyze the first algorithm given to me on Khan Academy.

### Language of Code: Javascript

⋅⋅⋅ The given algorithm finds at what index a certain number can be found in an array as well as uses the concept of Binary Search. The function doSearch is where the majority of the algorithm that finds the index of where a given number in an array is is. The function doSearch takes two inputs: the array (array) and the number which the function needs to find the index for (targetValue). The minimum index for the Binary Search is declared as zero and the maximum index for the Binary Search is declared to be the length of the array minus one since the first element in an array is stated to have an index of zero.  
⋅⋅⋅ The guess variable (to guess the index at which the number the index needs to be found for is found at) is declared and the guessNum variable (the number of guesses it takes to find at what index that certain number can be found at) is given a default value of zero. A while loop starts and will continue as long as the maximum index is greater than or equal to the minimum index. The variable guess is given the value of the average of the minimum and maximum index rounded down using Math.floor() since the program intends to narrow down at what index the certain number's at by continuously dividing the inputted array in half until the answer is found. Since the variable guess is assigned a new value (and, therefore, there is a new guess), guessNum is incremented by one. To verify that the program is working as intended, the variable guess is printed out to the console.
⋅⋅⋅ A conditional is set in place afterwards. If, when calling array with the guess for the index is equal to the number intending to be found (targetValue), the variable guessNum will be printed (how many guesses it took to find the index of the desired number in the array) and the variable guess will be returned (the index the desired number was found at).
