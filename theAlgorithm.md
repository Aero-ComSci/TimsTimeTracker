# Algorithm of Choice: Binary Search Algorithm
---
### I was unsure what exactly *"the algorithm"* was referring to, so I decided to choose to analyze the first algorithm given to me on Khan Academy.

### Language of Code: Javascript

⋅⋅⋅ The given algorithm finds at what index a certain number can be found in an array as well as uses the concept of Binary Search. The function doSearch is where the majority of the algorithm that finds the index of where a given number in an array is is. The function doSearch takes two inputs: the array and the number which the function needs to find the index for. The minimum index for the Binary Search is declared as zero and the maximum index for the Binary Search is declared to be the length of the array minus one since the first element in an array is stated to have an index of zero.  
⋅⋅⋅ The guess variable is declared and the guessNum variable is given a default value of zero. A while loop starts and will continue as long as the maximum index is greater than or equal to the minimum index.
