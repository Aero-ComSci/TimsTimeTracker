# Timothy's Time Tracker
---
### Timothy's Time Tracker is a program intended to allow users to track their deadlines and important events based on a "priority ranking" and their date. This program uses Object Oriented Programming to get certain events and deadlines, change events and deadlines, categorize events and deadlines by priority and their date, and delete events and deadlines. This program also utilizes a sorting algorithm in order to keep deadlines and events organized in a reasonable manner. This program solves the problem of student time management and prioritization, for this program only requires students to input deadlines and events as well as for them to ask what's high on their priority list or which assignments are due soon for them rather than requiring students to log on to a website and click a variety of buttons in order to see their deadlines and events or requiring students to look through a calendar and find a particular timeframe within said calendar. This program was intended to be practice for Object Oriented Programming, algorithms, and coding using the Github extension in Visual Studio Code by attempting to create a relatively unique program that implements these concepts. I learned how to read and edit JSON files using Python3, how to implement dunder methods, how to implement class inheritance, how to use .super() in Python, that I sometimes may need to change what program I create for an open-ended assignment, how to use deques and .appendleft(), how to utilize the collections library, how to use abstract methods, and how to use suppress from the contextlib library to suppress dialogue when a certain type of error comes up in my program.

## Features *ADD PICTURES*
---

### * The ability to delete assignments or events once completed or not done by the time the deadline passes
### * The ability to see exactly how many assignments or events fit a certain priority level or deadline
### * The ability for the user to exit out of the program when they want to
